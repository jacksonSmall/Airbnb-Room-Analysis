This group project, along with 3 others, uses machine learning to predict whether university students will graduate, drop out, or remain enrolled, given their individual academic, demographic, and financial data. We explored and cleaned a dataset of over 4,200 students, addressing class imbalance with SMOTE and selecting key features through statistical methods. After testing multiple classification models and tuning their hyperparameters, Logistic Regression and SVM showed the best performance, especially when combined in a soft voting ensemble. Our final model achieved a balanced F1-score of 0.74, highlighting the importance of early grades and tuition status in predicting student outcomes.
